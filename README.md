# Surfs Up Challenge - Weather Analysis for Oahu, HI 

## Overview of Project
This analysis was completed in order to help a client determine if the weather in Oahu, Hawaii is viable for starting a surf and ice cream shop that is open year-round.  The client is specifically concerned with the general temperatures that vary between months.  This analysis dives into the months of June and December, which are generally very different in climate in most areas of the world.  

## Results
Each deliverable for this project (June temperatures and December temperatures) was done individually with the code that can be seen below.

This code can easily be changed to work for june as well, which just involved changing the names of the queries and changing the month filter from '12' for December to '6' for June.  

### Major points from June and December Temperatures

Based on these summary statistics between the two months: 
* The average temperature during June is 74.9 degrees, while December is 71.0. This is only a variability of about 4 degrees between the six month difference.  This supports opening the surf/ice cream shop year round, as the weather will likely be warm (in the 70s) year round.  
* The minimum temperature recorded in June is 64 degrees, while December is 56. This is a wider variability, and it essentially means that December nights/low-temperature days will be slightly cooler than June nights/low-temperature days. I feel as if an 8 degree difference won't make enough difference to hold back from opening up the surf/ice cream shop. Especially since people typically enjoy both surfing and ice cream at an outdoor business before dark, when the weather will start to dip into these low and/or minimum temperatures.  
* The maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees, while December is 83.  This shows that there are nice, hot days in both June and December, further supporting opening the store year round.  Although the lower temperatures in December might vary a little more, there is still plenty of surf/ice cream weather to experience in December in Oahu, HI. 

## Summary
All in all, this analysis shows that the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures of June and December do not vary much in Oahu, HI. Due to the low variability (i.e. very consistent temperatures), it is safe to say that opening a surf/ice cream shop here would be safe and should do well if done correctly. This analysis only dives into the temperatures though, which is only one factor of looking at the environment in Oahu, HI. Another factor to consider would be the precipation that occurs in June and December.  This analysis was completed to see what the results would look like, which are shown in the images below:

As seen in the images above, there isn't much variability in the precipitation statistics between June and December. This even further supports opening the shop since the weather should stay relatively consistent and ideal for surfing and enjoying ice cream outside in the heat. Some other analyses that can be run if wanted would be comparing more than just June and December, and looking at other climate factors in Oahu, HI.
